# this is for the optional docker-compose mariadb service
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=rootpassword

# these are for mariadb service and the scrapy connection string (settings.py)
MYSQL_USER=user
MYSQL_PASSWORD=password
MYSQL_DATABASE=db_name

# this is only for the app connection string (settings.py)
# if using the mariadb service in docker-compose leave this as the service name, mariadb
